# TypeScript React without Redux

This is a TypeScript React implementation that useds React's `useReducer` to impelment a store without the need for Redux. Using TypesScript, we make the store immutable.

Uses:

- typescript: "^3.5.3"
- react: "^16.9.1"

Splits the typings into `./typings` directory.
